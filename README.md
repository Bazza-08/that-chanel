## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Learnt how to add or remove a <br> tag with the use of classes (small but helpful)
2. Value of the google inspect tool to help align height or find what padding or margins are interfering with correct sizes.

### Continued development

1. Understanding importing fonts.
2. Margins, paddings and sizing objects effectively.
3. Make code DRY

### Useful resources

- [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me understand some flexbox rules.
